# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains the complete architecture documentation for the Rust Todo App using the C4 model approach.

## C4 Model Overview

The C4 model provides a hierarchical way to describe software architecture through four levels of abstraction:

1. **Context** - System landscape and external dependencies
2. **Container** - High-level technology choices and responsibilities  
3. **Component** - Internal structure of containers
4. **Code** - Implementation details and class structures

## Documentation Structure

- [Level 1: System Context](01-system-context.md) - External users and systems
- [Level 2: Container Diagram](02-container-diagram.md) - Application containers and data stores
- [Level 3: Component Diagram](03-component-diagram.md) - Internal components and modules
- [Level 4: Code Diagram](04-code-diagram.md) - Implementation structure
- [Deployment Architecture](05-deployment.md) - Infrastructure and deployment patterns
- [Security Architecture](06-security.md) - Security controls and data flow

## Quick Navigation

| Level | Focus | Audience |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Context | System boundaries | Everyone |
| Container | Technology stack | Technical stakeholders |
| Component | Module structure | Developers |
| Code | Implementation | Development team |

## Architecture Principles

- **Performance First**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions for high throughput
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees prevent runtime errors
- **Async by Default**: Non-blocking I/O for scalability
- **API-First**: OpenAPI specification drives development
- **Security by Design**: Built-in authentication and authorization
- **Container Native**: Docker-first deployment strategy
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between routes, services, and repositories
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access for testability and maintainability
